### Java Cloud Native

This repository contains the examples from the Test section of the book [Cloud Native Java](https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Java-Designing-Resilient/dp/1449374646) by Josh Long.   
This project is a copy from the original git repo (that is in this [link](https://github.com/cloud-native-java)), but while the original use maven this one will use gradle.
