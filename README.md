### Java Cloud Native

This repository contains the examples from the Test section of the book [Cloud Native Java](https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Java-Designing-Resilient/dp/1449374646) by Josh Long.   
This project is a copy from the original git repo (that is in this [link](https://github.com/cloud-native-java)), but while the original use maven this one will use gradle.

PS: execute the modules using the e2e.sh script in the testing-basics or testing-microservices modules. 
Or using an IDE passing the vm args of the script.
